# AIDI_MLP_FINAL_PROJECT

The advancement of technology significantly impacts various aspects of life, including healthcare. Artificial intelligence, particularly, shows promising potential in revolutionizing healthcare through data analysis and decision-making. Early detection plays a crucial role in combating life-threatening diseases like COVID-19, which has swiftly become a global pandemic. Given its contagious nature, there's an urgent need for effective detection systems. Fortunately, the abundance of COVID-19 data enables us to harness technology for vital insights.

In this project, we evaluated different machine learning algorithms to predict COVID-19 accurately. Starting with the emergence of the novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, it rapidly escalated into a global crisis, prompting the World Health Organization to declare it a public health emergency. Symptoms typically manifest within 2-14 days, ranging from mild to severe, with those with underlying health conditions at higher risk. Given the virus's rapid spread and deadly consequences, developing a reliable detection system is imperative.

Machine learning algorithms, coupled with relevant datasets and software, serve as indispensable tools in constructing predictive models for COVID-19. This project aims to compare various algorithms such as Linear Regression, Support Vector Machine, XGBoost to determine their accuracies and select the most suitable one for predicting COVID-19 infection based on available data.

INSTRUCTIONS TO RUN THE CODE:

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to run Python code in a Jupyter Notebook that implements machine learning models like Linear Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and XGBoost:

1. Install Python and Jupyter Notebook:
If you haven't already, install Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/
After installing Python, you can install Jupyter Notebook using pip, the Python package manager. Run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

"pip install notebook"

2. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where your Jupyter Notebook file (with the Python code) is located.
Type jupyter notebook and press Enter. This will start the Jupyter Notebook server and open a new tab or window in your default web browser.
3. Open Your Notebook File:
In the Jupyter Notebook interface, navigate to the directory where your notebook file (.ipynb) is located.
Click on the notebook file to open it in a new tab or window.
4. Run Cells:
Your notebook is divided into cells, which can contain either code or text (Markdown). To run a code cell, click on it to select it, then press Shift + Enter or click the "Run" button in the toolbar above.
Start by running any necessary import statements and setting up your data.
5.Ensure Dependencies Are Installed:
Make sure you have all the necessary libraries installed, such as scikit-learn for machine learning models like Linear Regression and SVM, and XGBoost for XGBoost.
You can install these libraries using pip. For example

"pip install scikit-learn xgboost"

6. Load Data:
If your code requires data, make sure the data files are in the correct location and accessible from your notebook. Use appropriate functions or libraries (such as pandas) to load the data into your notebook.
7. Instantiate and Train Models:
Write code to instantiate the machine learning models (e.g., Linear Regression, SVM, XGBoost) and train them using your data.
8. Evaluate Models:
After training the models, evaluate their performance using appropriate metrics. This might involve splitting your data into training and testing sets, performing cross-validation, or other techniques.
9. Interpret Results:
Examine the results of your models' evaluations and draw conclusions about their performance and effectiveness.
10. Save and Share:
Once you're satisfied with your analysis, save your notebook. You can download it as a .ipynb file or export it to other formats like HTML or PDF.
If you want to share your notebook with others, you can upload it to platforms like GitHub, Google Colab, or Kaggle.
